## Libraries used:

This project integrates the Reveal.js core with several plugins.
* [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) (v3.3.0)
* [Menu](https://github.com/denehyg/reveal.js-menu) (plugin)
* [Chalkboard](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/chalkboard) (plugin)


## Notes:

* Slides (.md or .html) should be placed in `_slidedecks`.  Subfolders may be used.
* Fix added to Reveal.js 3.3.0:  css updated to [address fullscreen issue](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/a12a17b2d7053fad006ae9914309e8fb56c44329)
* You must access your slides with .html extension addressing (e.g. `example.com/slide.html` and not `example.com/slide/`).  This is necessary for path-relative image URLs to work in slidedecks.
* Chalkboard:  Default keybindings changed for the Chalkboard plugin to avoid conflicts.
